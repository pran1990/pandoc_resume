Experience
----------

**Senior Member of Technical Staff, Oracle Inc.**, 2011-present
Stress, Performance, Destructive Testing for Oracle 11g, 12c.

* Design/Development/Execution of multi-tier stress test suites simulating
  real-world customer scenarios to uncover Product defects and enhance product
  quality. Architect large-scale, high-load, massively concurrent end-to-end
  test applications to assess Oracle Database's scalability, reliability,
  availability and performance.

Oracle ACFS support for databases - ASM cluster file system.

* Worked on developing stress tests for storing database files on Oracle ACFS.
  Designed and implemented test framework based on PL/SQL, SQL, shell scripts
  for different types of database workload generation covering data mining,
  OLTP, securefiles and comprehensive testing of features across Oracle RDBMS,
  including data layer, recovery and backup, query execution and optimisation,
  filesystem throughput across various operating systems - Linux, Solaris, AIX,
  Windows.

* Developed C++ extension stress test for ACFS plugins to calculate filesystem
  metrics using OOPS paradigm

* Built a C/C++ based test application to test sparse files on ACFS that
  starts a multiprocess/multithreaded workload to create sparse files, test
  various types of I/O on holes and data blocks.

[Exadata](https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/index.html)

* Worked on stress and performance testing of bundle patches for Exadata,
  ACFS support on Exadata, WBFC (write back flash cache) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, EHCC(Exadata Hybrid Columnar Compression) support for ACFS on
  Exadata, sparse diskgroups to store datafiles on Exadata.

* Cross functional testing of multitenant container databases (CDB),
  In-Memory,Compression, Data Guard, RAC, ASM on ACFS/Exadata

Mentor: S.A.V.Satya Murty, Associate Director, Electronics and Instrumentation Group

* Application Protocols-Computer Networks, 2009
  Studied network connectivity in IGCAR’s LAN setup and various Application
  Layer protocols – FTP, TELNET, DNS, Email server and Web server, their
  properties and configured them in UNIX environment.

* Packet Analysis using Socket programming in C, 2009
  Studied Network programming and established connection oriented and
  connectionless Client-Server communications, captured packets and analyzed
  their properties.

* Packet Sniffing And Intrusion Detection System, 2010
  Developed C code for intrusion detection and logged the packets, configured
  SNORT as Network Intrusion Detection System and analyzed real time traffic,
  configured GUI software – Ntop to graphically analyze and monitor traffic in
  IGCAR for network management and security
