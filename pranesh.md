Experience
----------

**Tech Yahoo, Intermediate, Yahoo Inc:**, 2013-present  
[Openstack](http://www.openstack.org/) developer 

* Getting OpenStack to be used at Y! (as its core infrastructure), which 
  involves code changes to OpenStack, conferences and session talks on needed 
  features (ie to be used at Y! scale) and integration into Y!'s core systems 
  and ensuring the work that Y! does is given back to the community.

**Graduate Research Assistant, Georgia Tech**, 2012-2013  

* Computation Offloading for mobile applications  
  Automatically detect and offload computation-intensive components of mobile 
  applications to the cloud, while accounting for intermittent connectivity to
  the internet. Implemented on android.
    * COSMOS: Computation Offloading as a Service for Mobile Devices.  
      Cong Shi, Karim Habak, Pranesh Pandurangan, Mostafa Ammar, Mayur Naik,
      and Ellen Zegura. MobiHoc'14: ACM Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking 
      and Computing.
* Intermittent Storage for Mobile Devices  
  Framework to enable mobile devices to temporarily offload files to nearby devices
  when out of space and lacking network connectivity. Implemented the framework in the
  [ONE simulator](http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/)

**Interim Engineering Intern, Qualcomm Inc.**, 2012  

* Designed and implemented a task level profiling tool in C and Python. This
  was a software implementation of a hardware tool used in judging modem
  performance

**Intern, TU Darmstadt**, 2010  

* Exploring Visual Self-localisation Algorithms for Mobile Platforms  
  Map the movement of a robot, given a sequence of stereo images taken from it.

**Visiting Intern, National University of Singapore**, 2009  

* Coordinated Behaviour of Multiple robots  
  Implemented a military escort system using a few commodity robots (Rovio from WowWee)
  and Player/Stage software

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   Contributed reviews and code upstream on several openstack projects,
    core in taskflow (https://wiki.openstack.org/TaskFlow) and anvil
    (https://anvil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Entropy
:   Entropy is a framework to write cluster-check scripts, and reaction scripts 
    to the errors/issues these audits raise. This automates reacting to failure. 
    A potentially more important use is to aggregate failures, notice trends in 
    failures, and developing a database of known failures to make dealing with
    new ones easier.
